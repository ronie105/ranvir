# 🌫️ Air Quality Analysis & Visualization

This project explores and visualizes India's air pollution levels using real-world Air Quality Index (AQI) data. It focuses on identifying the most polluted cities, trends over the years, seasonal patterns, and pollutant relationships using Python and data visualization libraries.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: `city_day.csv` (includes daily air quality data for multiple Indian cities)
- Features: `Date`, `City`, `PM2.5`, `PM10`, `NO₂`, `SO₂`, `CO`, `O₃`, etc.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas** (data cleaning and aggregation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (static visualizations)
- **Plotly** (interactive charts)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (analysis notebook)

---

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed

1. **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**
   - Converted `Date` to datetime format
   - Handled missing values
   - Created `Year` and `Month` features

2. **Pollution Insights**
   - Top 10 polluted cities (by PM2.5)
   - Yearly PM2.5 trends (top 5 cities)
   - Monthly average PM2.5 levels

3. **Visualizations**
   - 📈 Line plots (trends over years)
   - 📊 Bar charts (polluted cities)
   - 🌡️ Heatmaps (correlation between pollutants)
   - 🧱 Stacked bar charts (pollutant composition by city)

4. **Correlation Matrix**
   - Explored relationships between pollutants using a heatmap

## 📈 Project Outcome

This project provides environmental insights into air pollution across Indian cities, helps identify urban areas most affected, and visualizes how pollution has evolved over time. It demonstrates proficiency in data cleaning, trend analysis, and visualization techniques.
